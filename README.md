Project title: SALES DATA ANALYSIS.

Project goal: Analyze sales data to identify trends, top-selling products, and revenue metrics for business decision-making.

Tools used: Excel and Power BI

Dataset: 185,951 rows and 10 columns.

Tasks done by Excel on this project:

Generated the profit column by subtracting the price of each product from their sales.
Separated the time from the date, which was combined in the same column, into a different column.
Tasks done by Power BI:

Visualizations
KPI (Key Performance Indicator)
Analysis of the project:

KPIs: Total profit, Total price for each product, Total quantity ordered, and Total sales.

The first four products with higher sales are: Macbook Pro Laptop, iPhone, Thinkpad Laptop, and Google Phone.
The last four products with lower sales are: AAA Batteries, Wired Headphones, USB Charging Cable, and Lightning Charging Cable.
Sales started increasing from September to December in the year.
Suggestions:
I think products with low sales should be advertised to the media or nearby customers. This could help attract more customers for those products. Additionally, importing more diverse products into the company could increase overall revenue.
